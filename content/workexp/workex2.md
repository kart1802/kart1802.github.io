The internship was done from December 2021 till March 2022 under [Prof. Shishir Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/).

Here, my major role was to develop a structure around the abduction area of the quadruped necessary enough to sustain fatigue loads and also make an entire responsive foot prototype made out of TPU.

Through this internship, I was able to apply the machine design and analysis concept in building an agile quadruped robot.
