I worked at DRDO for 2 months in the months from June to July 2022 under the guidance of Scientist 'D' Shri. Ramachandra Kodi.

My topic for the internship was "Multi-Grasp Arm Manipulation" where a single arm was used to manipulate varied size objects using multiple grasping positions.

The project was done in simulation using ROS, Gazebo.

MoveIt was used for trajectory planning and 6D Pose of an object with multiple grasping positions/possibilities were determined using GraspNet.
