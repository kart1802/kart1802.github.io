Inspired by Tesla's self-driving cars, the automated parking of a car in the simulation was the aim of few students including me in 2020.

This project was done under Eklavya Mentorship Program conducted every year in summer by SRA where our seniors help us in implementing a non-physical idea into reality.

The simulation software was Coppeliasim. My work area was to park the car parallelly.

The flow of parking was to detect an empty area and check out the dimensions of the empty area using sensors to ensure safe parking of the car.

The type of parking was made dependent on the orientation of cars around the parking space.
