This contest was organized by Delta Electronics in March 2021 and me along with 2 other people formed a team and we had to submit a proposal that highlighted our idea of the project

We proposed a solution for efficient segregation and packaging of different sized boxes for a warehouse.
    
The plan was to make a gantry-based system for pick, place, and sorting of different size boxes into a bigger box with maximizing the volume occupancy and getting the size and orientation of boxes using vision.

We started developing and improving our gantry bot design by reaching out to various professors and industrial experts.

After the design was finalized, the parts were manufactured by different manufacturing techniques. In the end, the fabrication of the bot was carried out.

We assembled the parts and tested the desired motions of the bot and conveyor.

Overcoming the obstacles that we faced especially due to the pandemic, we managed to bag Second Category Prize and were in Top 40 globally
