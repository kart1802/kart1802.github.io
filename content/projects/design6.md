description: A project that eased the process of creating a resume with user-preferenced templates
---

A website to simplify the creation of a universally accepted and very significant document called the Resume.

The Front end of the website was done with the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap whereas the back-end was done in Python Flask. Latex was used to make templates of the Resume.

Community of Coders (COC) started Inheritance Mentorship Program in 2020 and we used to get advice for any type of changes to be made from seniors.

The Backend part and template making part was under my control
