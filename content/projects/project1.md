description: A study and experiment of a soft robot hand in SOFA
---

This was one of my personal projects that I did in Summer 2022.
    
Soft Robot Simulation is one of the challenging topics till now so many data-driven approaches are extensively researched upon. Simulation software like SOFA makes it easy to work and their solvers do the work showing close to realistic behaviours.
    
The prototypes were designed in SolidWorks and the FEM analysis of these structures were carried out.
    
Based on the higher bending angle on application of same amount of pressure, Prototype 4 was chosen for the simulation purpose
    
The structure was meshed and exported for simulation
    
After importing in SOFA, various material properties, solvers, and constraints were defined and satisfactory motion of fingers were recorded
