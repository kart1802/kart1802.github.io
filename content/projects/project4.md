SRA Autosim Challenge was conducted by SRA in December 2020. A team of 4 was made for this as well.

The competition involved building a urdf from scratch, solving grids using the shortest path to dump boxes at certain locations, line following using the camera, and wall following using lidar. After every step was done we had to end at the starting point.

Everything was done in ROS and Gazebo and algorithms were written in Python. I was responsible for making the URDF of the bot and writing algorithm for line following.

We were in Top 3 in our college.
