E-yantra is a robotics competition held by IIT Bombay which is approximately 6 months long consisting of tasks that have to be completed in a stipulated time.

The competition contained several themes corresponding to topics like ROS, Image Processing, FPGA, and many more.

A team of 4 was made from our side and the theme we got was Vitarana (Delivery) Drone.

Just as the name says, the end goal of the task was to control a drone, and using Obstacle Avoidance, Path Planning algorithms deliver the parcels from one place to other.

ROS and Gazebo were used for the simulation. Image processing techniques were used to detect QR codes and landing spots. Using PID the drone was tuned. I contributed to the logic behind the obstacle avoidance and path planning code.

After completing all the tasks, we reached the Top 20
