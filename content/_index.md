**Welcome to my portfolio website**

I am a Research Assistant at [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad advised by Prof. [K Madhava Krishna](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/), Prof. [Mohan Sridharan](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/msridhar/), and Dr. [Krishna Murthy](https://krrish94.github.io/). Previously, I have worked with Prof. [Shishir Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) at IISc on building mechanical structures for quadruped, Prof. [Faruk Kazi](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-faruk-kazi-vjti) at VJTI on developing an Industrial Robot capable of solving the problem of Bin packing. My research interests are in the domain of Manipulation, Controls, Learning and Soft Robotics. My current research works are on integrating intelligence for grippers that are capable of performing In-Hand Manipulation, Collaborative cost reduction in the domain of Human-Robot Collaboration for household tasks.
