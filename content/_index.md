**Welcome to my portfolio website**

I'm currently doing my Masters in Robotics at TUDelft. Prior to joining the masters program, I was working as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at [RBCCPS, IISc](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) under Prof. [Ravi Prakash](https://ravipr009.github.io). I worked as a Research Assistant at [Robotics Research Center](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad advised by Prof. [K Madhava Krishna](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/), Prof. [Mohan Sridharan](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/msridhar/), and Dr. [Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula](https://krrish94.github.io/). Previously, I have worked under Prof. [Shishir Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) at IISc on building mechanical structures for quadruped, Prof. [Faruk Kazi](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-faruk-kazi-vjti) at VJTI on developing an Industrial Robot capable of solving the problem of bin packing. My research interests are in the domain of Manipulation, Planning, Learning and Soft Robotics. I wish to delve deeper into combining Dynamical Systems and RL for Long-Horizon Manipulation task. My past research works focused on developing low-cost, simplistic gripper for In-Hand Manipulation, Collaborative cost reduction in the domain of Human-Robot Collaboration for household tasks.
